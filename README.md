# git_shellscripte

Aim of this project is to allow automatic* but flexible docker-compose updates and to learn more
about bash shellscripts.



Todo:

* [x] update all my docker-compose container with one script
* [x] auto search for docker-compose container to allow use on differenz servers without changeing the script
* [x] add no autoupdate for containers (e.g. mailcow with own update script)
* [ ] create cleaner output
* [x] Get used to NVIM commands or at least calm down when hitting the wrong keys

# Version control:

03.07.21: testing branch started to play around  
15.06.21: first version with basic function  
23.05.24: Added the "no autoupdate" function for mailcow
