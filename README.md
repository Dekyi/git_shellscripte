# git_shellscripte

Aim of this project is to allow automatic* but flexible docker-compose updates and to learn more
about bash shellscripts.



Todo:

* [x] update all my docker-compose container with one script
* [x] auto search for docker-compose container to allow use on differenz servers without changeing the script
* [ ] add no autoupdate for containers (e.g. mailcow with own update script)
* [ ] add logfile support for cron
* [ ] add error messages and checks for failure
* [ ] add email warnings when running via cron
* [ ] create cleaner output
* [ ] automatic check for script updates (see mailcow update.sh script)
* [x] Get used to NVIM commands or at least calm down when hitting the wrong keys
